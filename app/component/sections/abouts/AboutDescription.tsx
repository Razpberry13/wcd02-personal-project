      I&aposm Farraz, a Data Science student interested in technology and creative visuals. I&aposm currently focused on learning web development, databases, and communication protocols like sFTP.
  
      Outside of studying, I&aposm a freelance photographer and developing a home-based screen printing business. I also create film-themed YouTube Shorts â€” for me, learning and creating are inextricably linked.
